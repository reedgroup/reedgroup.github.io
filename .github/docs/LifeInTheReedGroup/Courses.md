| CEE 5980 - Decision Analysis                                    | Framework to structure the way we think about decision situations that  are complicated by uncertainty, complexity, and competing objectives.  Specific decision analysis concepts and tools, such as decision trees,  sensitivity analysis, value of information, and utility theory.  Applications to all areas of engineering and life. Includes a group  project to analyze a real-world decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |          |       |
| CEE 6660 - Multiobjective Systems Engineering Under Uncertainty | Exploration of engineering design frameworks that effectively exploit simulation, optimization, and uncertainty assessments when balancing  large numbers of conflicting performance objectives. Students will  learn and advance software frameworks that combine evolutionary  multiobjective optimization, high performance computing, uncertainty  modeling techniques, and visual design analytics. The primary focus  will be improving multi-stakeholder design of complex engineered systems.  Course concepts will be demonstrated using case studies and projects drawn  from the disciplines of the students enrolled. |          |       |
| CEE 6200 - Water Resources Systems Engineering                  | Development and application of deterministic and stochastic optimization  and simulation models for aiding in water-resources planning and management.  Covers river-basin modeling, including water allocation to multiple purposes,  reservoir design and operation, irrigation planning and operation,  hydropower-capacity development, flow augmentation, flood control and  protection, and urban water supply portfolio management.                                                                                                                                                                                        |          |       |

| BEE 4310 - Multivariate Statistics fo Environmental Applications                                     | This class provides an introduction to relatively simple but powerful multivariate statistical techniques needed to analyze and model complex datasets frequently encountered in the environmental sciences. Emphasis is given to developing the mathematical foundation of these methods to foster a deeper understanding of the benefits and limitations of different approaches. The goal is to provide students in the applied environmental sciences with a toolbox of methods not taught in more introductory statistical courses, but also to ensure that students can use these methods in their own work without viewing them as a "black box". The course only assumes a limited knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and statistics, and will provide a review of the mathematical concepts needed to understand the multivariate techniques presented. Applications will be presented primarily from the geophysical and ecological sciences, but the theory will be applicable to other environmental fields. Upon completion of the course, students will be able to use the multivariate techniques presented in the course to understand and evaluate environmental problems of interest in their respective domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  [Syllabus](https://files.classes.cornell.edu/prod/syllabus-file/2811/30e2c41d6d5c30154abd65a672def4632817c63d84c4663ee40564ca469f85dd-processed?response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22Syllabus-SP22-BEE4310-LEC001-PRIOR-TERM.pdf%22&Expires=1683048094&Signature=g3aD24smUn1QnbZ1jgkMNf2nqpUgyrTrvsMOPskjkLAEqoJKOk4iQML1OA5ZB8yoFvp~Xpqf86bPMyfGSzl1H9Z3EuSy9KHvu0B08WAtyqH7FvJaGvGi7fKE7kMXmhUWzQByfyK-l3uOiT1n0nuhQ1e3ViMUmLF7UuoVFzv0vB5qi4z4TZIHz79grUDGUrTLeo0CeW1MdWSGy3Ovpmdw~sLyV6WlQWYR-wCYw7aLyV3-BbdwXrezltNzmLkI20X0OFKRru~ZdytChkrCQ3LhcbDd4xKDU0gJRuSfNDB3TDXctFEWA9Z8DrHh7rLs6TQ6xFISQmCaoTWRsazIcSm6dw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJXQMOEC4XTD5SXSQ)        |       |
