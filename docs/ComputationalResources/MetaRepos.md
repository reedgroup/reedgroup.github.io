# Creating and Using GitHub Meta Repositories

GitHub meta-repositories (metarepo) are powerful communication tools that store detailed instructions so that others can reproduce results and analysis in your published work. 

To clone an example metarepo, see this [template](https://github.com/IMMM-SFA/metarepo) from the IM3 community. You can also view the full guide [here](https://immm-sfa.github.io/metarepo/).
