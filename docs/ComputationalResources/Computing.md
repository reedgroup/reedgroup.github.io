## Python

### Installing Python (Windows)
This material is drawn from the ["Python Programmer" Youtube chanel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FlickThrough). There are many ways to install Python, but we like this one because it gets you started using virtual environments from the start. 
See a Youtube video describing the steps below [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28eLP22SMTA&t=572s).
(Procedure from )
1. Open command prompt
2. Navigate to your directory (C:\Users\YourName) 
3. Create two new directories using mkdir:
    a. pyver
    b. pyproj
4. 4. Download python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
5. Start the python installer from your download folder
6. Select “Customize installation” (and do not check box for “Add Python 3.X to PATH)
7. In the “Customize installation location” browse to the “pyver” directory created above and add a new folder for the python version you’re installing
8. navigate to the "pyproj" directory created in step 3
9. Create and activate a new virtual environment (here we’ll call this my_env) by typing: 
```
 C:\Users\YourName\pyver\python\py383 -m venv my_env
```
10. Actieate the environment by typing:
```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
11. All done! You can deactivate using:
```
deactivate
```
