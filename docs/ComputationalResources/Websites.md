# Building and deploying websites with Python

[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) are two
great Python packages that can be used to build static websites without having to learn HTML. 
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are automated scripts that run on GitHub repositories, for
example each time a new commit is made, in order to facilitate continuous integration/continuous delivery.
And [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a free website hosting functionality on GitHub. Taken together, these
tools can help to create, deploy, and host websites with no prior HTML experience. This lab manual was itself created
using Jupyter Books, GitHub Actions, and GitHub Pages.
