Linux is a key operating system that we run many of our models on (instead of Windows) and is the primary operation system on HPC clusters. It's important to become familiar with navigating around Linux environments using the command line. 

If you are a complete newbie to Linux, it is helpful to take one of the many free classes offered by LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/linux-2. You will also pick up commands and syntax through training.
