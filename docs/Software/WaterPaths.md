# WaterPaths

![](SedentoLayout.png)

WaterPaths is a generalizable, cloud-compatible, open-source exploratory modeling system designed to inform long-term regional investments in water infrastructure while simultaneously aiding regions to improve their short-term weekly management decisions, often made in response to droughts. WaterPaths has the capability to identify coordinated planning and management for groups of water utilities sharing water resources. WaterPathsâ€™ exploits dynamic and adaptive risk-of-failure (ROF) rules to trigger management and planning actions in temporally consistent pathways. The C++ source code and instructions for use can be found at on [Github](https://github.com/bernardoct/WaterPaths).
