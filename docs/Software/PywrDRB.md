# Pywr-DRB

[Pywr-DRB](https://github.com/Pywr-DRB/Pywr-DRB) is a water resources simulation model of the Delaware River Basin (DRB) designed to improve our understanding of water availability, drought risk, and long-term water supply planning within the basin. 

This is a free, open-source, Python-based model.
