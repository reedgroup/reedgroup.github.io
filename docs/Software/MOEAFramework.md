# MOEA Framework

![](MOEA_framework_logo.png)

[MOEA Framework](http://moeaframework.org/) is a free, open-source Java framework for experimenting with several popular MOEAs including GDE3, MOEA/D, NSGA-II, ε-MOEA, ε-NSGA-II and random search. These MOEAs can be run on over 80 test problems, including problems from the ZDT, DTLZ and WFG test problem suites, as well as all constrained and unconstrained problems from the IEEE CEC 2009 special competition. If you're new to the MOEA framework or would like to connect own optimization problems, read through the [MOEAFramework Setup Guide](http://moeaframework.org/examples.html).
