# Rhodium

> *"[Rhodium](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Rhodium) is an open source Python library for robust decision making (RDM) and multiobjective robust decision making (MORDM), and exploratory modeling (EM)."* 

Rhodium is part of the broader [Project Platypus](https://github.com/Project-Platypus) which contains a collection of different libraries for optimization and decision making support.
