# SALib

The Sensitivity Analysis Library in Python ([SALib](https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) is a package used to perform various sensitivity analysis techniques.  

SALib can be used to generate samples of input parameters, and calculate various sensitivity indices associated with each parameter. For information on how to use SALib, see the following collection of WaterProgramming blog posts as well as the [SALib documentation here](https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
