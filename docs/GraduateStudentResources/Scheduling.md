# Scheduling
In the public Google folder [linked here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zN13E5CDj5RYKj94fh7nGU_OZu3nm_wB?usp=sharing), you will be able to locate four Excel spreadsheets that outline simple semester schedule examples and templates. You will find that the first sheet is a summary of the following sheets that contains broad topics/projects of focus. The following sheets contain more detailed tasks broken down by day, paper, assignment, etc. This may be used as a tool to obtain a general overview on what your main time commitments will be throughout the semester. The following list briefly describes the contents of this folder:

1. `Schedule Template.xlsx` is a general blank semester scheduling template
2. `Schedule Example [by category].xlsx` is an example schedule that partitions overall tasks by category (classes, research, readings, training, etc.)
3. `Schedule Example [by project].xlsx` is an example schedule that partitions overall tasks by project (main class final projects, research projects, etc.)
4. `Planning Gantt Chart.xlsx` is a Gantt chart template that provides a useful visual aid to help track your progress over the semester.
