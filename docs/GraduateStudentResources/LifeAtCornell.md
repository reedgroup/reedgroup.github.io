# Some info on life here at Cornell

## Where to live
March/April is ideal time to find a lease that begins in August, though there are usually a few places still available in June/July. In terms of neighborhoods, it helps to first describe Ithaca's geography a bit. Ithaca is surrounded by three hills and a lake (to the north). Cornell is on the east hill, Ithaca College on the south hill. Downtown is situated in the middle of the hills along with a neighborhood called Fall Creek. Grad students usually live either Downtown, in Fall Creek, Cayuga Heights (just north of Cornell) or on East Hill (around an area called "East Hill Plaza"). All these are an easy bus ride away from campus. In the summer there is also a beautiful gorge trail you can walk from downtown/Fall Creek that leads almost directly to the engineering building. It takes 30-40 minutes to walk to Campus from downtown and 15-20 minutes to take the bus.
