# The Fisheries Game

## Overview

This training is designed to replicate the study presented in [Antonia Hadjimichael's 2020 paper, *Navigating Deeply Uncertain Tradeoffs in Harvested Predator-Prey Systems.](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/4170453/)

This training consists of three parts, detailed in the Activities below and presented on the WaterProgramming blog. All of the code used in the tutorial is hosted in a GitHub repository: [harvested_predator_prey_system_tutorial_series.](https://github.com/TrevorJA/harvested_predator_prey_system_tutorial_series)

## Learning objectives

- Summary of a learning outcome
- Another summary of a different outcome

## Prerequisites

Make note of other trainings and skills that are needed for the activities and link to internal Computational Resources pages.

See the Necessary Software at the bottom of this page prior to starting the training activities.
