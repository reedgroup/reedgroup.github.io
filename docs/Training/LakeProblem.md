# The Shallow Lake Problem


## Background
*Placeholder from Julie's paper*

Managing socio-ecological systems is a challenge wrought by competing societal objectives, deep uncertainties, and potentially irreversible tipping points. A classic, didactic example is the shallow lake problem in which a hypothetical town situated on a lake must develop pollution control strategies to maximize its economic benefits while minimizing the probability of the lake crossing a critical phosphorus (P) threshold, above which it irreversibly transitions into a eutrophic state. Here, you'll explore two optimization strategies to design robust pollution control rules for the town that account for deeply uncertain system characteristics and conflicting objectives.
