# The Shallow Lake Problem


## Background
Managing socio-ecological systems is a challenge wrought by competing societal objectives, deep uncertainties, and potentially irreversible tipping points. A classic example is the shallow lake problem in which a hypothetical town situated on a lake must develop pollution control strategies to maximize its economic benefits while minimizing the probability of the lake crossing a critical phosphorus (P) threshold, above which it irreversibly transitions into a eutrophic (polluted) state. Here, you'll explore two optimization strategies to design robust pollution control rules for the town that account for deeply uncertain system characteristics and conflicting objectives. 

## Training objectives
* Visualize dynamics of a socio-ecological system and identify tipping points
* Get familiar with Python code to simulate the shallow lake problem
* Implement a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to discover non-dominated decision alternatives
* Visualize tradeoffs between conflicting objectives
* Evaluate MOEA performance by implementing common performance measures for evolutionary algorithms
* Examine the impact of uncertainties using global sensitivity analysis
* Discover thresholds in the uncertainty space that lead to policy alternatives crossing the irreversible tipping point
