# Synthetic Weather Generation

## Introduction

There are a series of excellent blog posts that step through many different aspects of synthetic weather generation, including parametric weather generation techniques, non-parametric and semi-parametric weather generators, techniques for correlating weather generated at multiple sites, and conditioning weather generation on climate change projections and seasonal climate forecasts

## Learning Objectives

This series of blog posts doesn't have any interactive components like the synthetic streamflow generation sereis, but rather can be viewed as more filtered background reading on synthetic weather generation. 

## Prerequisites
None

  - N/A
  - You will learn about non-parametric generators, in which the underlying distribution is not known, and future realizations are simulated by resampling from the historical record.
