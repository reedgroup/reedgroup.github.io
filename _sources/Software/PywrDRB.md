# Pywr-DRB

[Pywr-DRB](https://github.com/Pywr-DRB/Pywr-DRB) is a water resources simulation model of the Delaware River Basin (DRB) designed to improve our understanding of water availability, drought risk, and long-term water supply planning within the basin. 

This is a free, open-source, Python-based model.

You can access a pre-print of the model release publication here:

We have set up Pywr-DRB training activities, with guidence available on [the Pywr-DRB Training page.](../Training/pywrdrb_training.md)
