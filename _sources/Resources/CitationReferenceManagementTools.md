## Citation Tools
Here are some citation tools we regularly use in the Reed Group. Click on the title of each tool's description to take a look at their individual sites.

### [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/)
Self-described as "Spotify for Papers", the main idea behind Research Rabbit can be boiled down into three main points:
1. Organization of papers and authors
2. Discovery of papers and authors within similar or adjacent topics/fields
3. Visualizing the connections between papers within Research Rabbit 'Categories'

Research Rabbit can also be integrated with Zotero folders to create categories specific to your pre-existing research topics. You can also share categories with collaborators to enable them to add their own reference papers as well. Effective use of Research Rabbit, however, depends on the fact that you need an initial set of papers of interest for it to suggest more. 

Further information on Research Rabbit can be found [here](https://researchrabbit.notion.site/Welcome-to-the-FAQ-c33b4a61e453431482015e27e8af40d5#d15aebe6726647e086cdc935f2067bf5).
