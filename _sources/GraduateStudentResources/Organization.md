# Organizational Tools
As part of the Reed Group you'll be managing research projects, course work, and collaborations that will include a mix of methodologies, data sources, and timelines. In this environment it is essential to have an organizational structure to help you stay organized and on top of projects. Note taking software can be a great way to stay organized, coordinate job diaries and keep track of file locations. This page has background on tools that have been used by current and former Reed group members

## Notion

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) is an organizational tool to help you organize thoughts, manage projects, and keep track of notes. The app is highly customizable and has a variety of prebuilt templates to get started. Notion pages can be made collaboratively or shared to groups. It has extensive multimedia capabilities and some advanced methods for managing data. A major drawback of Notion is that it is entirely web-based, so you need an internet connection to use the app (as of June 2023).
