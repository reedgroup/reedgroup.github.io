# QPPQ Streamflow Prediction in Ungauged Basins

## Introduction

Predicting streamflow at ungauged locations is a classic problem in hydrology which has motivated significant research over the last several decades (Hrachowitz, Markus, et al., 2013).

There are numerous different methods for performing predictions in ungauged basins. One popular approach is referred to as QPPQ. 

## Learning objectives

- Gain familiarity with PUB literature
- Acknowledge and distinguish multiple traditional QPPQ methods
- Be able to perform streamflow prediction using the traditional weighted QPPQ approach
