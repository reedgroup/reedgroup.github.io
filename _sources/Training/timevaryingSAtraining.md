# Time-Varying Sensitivity Analysis

## Introduction

This training follows a blog post that steps through the process of performing local variance-based sensitivity analysis (SA), and then plotting how it changes over time for a multi-reservoir system in the Red River Basin in Vietnam. This set of techniques are broadly applicable to other global SA methods, as well as specialized forms of SA such as magnitude-varying SA.  

## Learning Objectives

In these training, you will learn how to perform and visualize local variance-based time-varying sensitivity analysis.

## Prerequisites 
These training require general proficiency in Python. If you are new to Python, you can get started [here](https://reedgroup.github.io/ComputationalResources/python_crash_course.html).
