# Synthetic Streamflow Generation

## Overview

There are a series of excellent blog posts that step through different types of synthetic streamflow generation techniques that the group often uses. Some techniques, like the Hidden Markov Model-based generation are appropriate for regions like the Western U.S. that exhibit persistence in the form of longer decadal to multi-decadal drought. The Kirsch-Nowak Generator has been used in location such as the Lower Susquehanna River Basin, Red River, Research Triangle region.
