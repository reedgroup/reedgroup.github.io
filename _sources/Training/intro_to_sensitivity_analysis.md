# Introduction to Sensitivity Analysis

*This site is still under construction*

If you're wondering what the deal with Sensitivity Analysis, is, please follow tutorial in the [Jupyter notebook
here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lbl59/lab_manual_resources/8546b1278e46f9d8b31d9de4bac6a74352799377?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fsensitivity_analysis.ipynb). After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:
1. Install and use basic Python sensitivity analysis packages
2. Understand the uses and limitations of different sensitivity analysis methods
3. Implement local and global sensitivity analysis methods
4. Understand the differences in the mathematical formulations of these methods
5. Apply sensitivity analyis to a small dataset

In this tutorial, the dataset you will be using consists of two files :
1. Objectives_f125.csv 
2. financial_model_DVs.csv

Please ensure that both these files are in the same folder as your Jupyter notebook before beginning.
